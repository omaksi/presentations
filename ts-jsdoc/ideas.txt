TS w JSDoc

1. do you even JS/TS?

2. 1st contact with TS = TS language + .ts + compile + tsc + tsconfig + .d.ts + wtf

3. Code mess example

4. There's a different way = JSDoc - Incremental implementation, most features of TS, Documentation, full VSCode support

5. JSDoc annotation + Nice code example
